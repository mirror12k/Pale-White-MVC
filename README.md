# Pale-White mvc framework
Pale-White is a model-view-controller framework designed to simplify design by abstracting away from php/sql/html.
PaleWhite models and controllers are compiled to standard php classes to provide easy of support and debugging.
A database abstraction layer allows full use of database-backed models without writing any database queries, and provides security against injection attacks like SQLi.
A templating language based on Jade provides fast and extensible front-end development.

## requirements
requires perl Sugar library for compiling models/views/controllers.
also requires perl Make::SSH library to compile the example project.make's.
