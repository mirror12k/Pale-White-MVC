wishlist:
	meta objects for models
	an admin backend for viewing/editting models as listed items

further wishlist:
	passing templates as arguments and values
		!template SuperTemplate
			div.super_container
				// invoke template from variable
				!template $dynamic_template
				// pass the name of a template
				!template RenderContainerTemplate template="UserContainerTemplate"

	extensible helper plugins
	optional compilation to a big javascript package to allow client-side sites

controlled wishlist:
	regex path arguments
		path "/page/{{page=/\d+/}}" {}

	websockets/ajax client-heavy site
		load all glass templates as client-side javascript files
		and have all actions exposed via websockets or ajax
		have controllers mostly loaded on client-side
		hook location switches and have a client-side controller process to perform a simple server request
			server picks the template and template args for it, as well as performing any controller actions required
			server returns a json response which tells client-side which template with which arguments to load
		templates should be optionally markable as client-side only using cached model data to avoid excessive server-side requests
			this would require client-side controllers fully implementing the template and model picking logic for those paths
			can mark these paths as static so that they are compiled into the client-side controller
	transplant comments directly to compiled php code
	a cli to perform server-side action easier?
	automatic admin backend for viewing and editting modeled objects?
	a description package which outlines all contained packages?
	view controllers to easily assign logic to specific views?

	a testing suite which is done from server-side cli php execution
		doesnt render templates fully, just returns the template names and arguments passed as the test status
		this way controller logic can be checked without depending on templating output

more wishlist:
	abstract models to serve as references to other models
		this would allow easily extending allowable values


	optional model and file arguments with a question mark
	increment/decrement operators for model properties
	array type validators for controllers
	jquery like library?
	script minimization during compilation?
	delay template rendering until output phase
		this allows controller validation tests
		also removes posibility of templates errors muddying controllers


	reference validation
		parses all models, controllers, templates, file directories, and native library declarations
		cross references these at every step to ensure that all references to these objects are valid
		this will turn several runtime errors into compile time errors


	filedirectory file listing


	javascript on timer
	javascript on scroll

	rate limited download?
	interface for sendable stuff?

	virtual paths
		// mark paths with labels:
			homepage: path "/" {...}
		// inline virtual paths:
			a href=&homepage
		// inline virtual paths with arguments:
			modelpage: path "/model/{{model_id}}" {...}
			...
			a href=&modelpage{model_id=15}
		// compiles to function invokation:
			$this->virtual_path("modelpage", array('model_id' => '15'));

	modeldeltas to create and delete models
		create model Asdf {
			...
		}
		delete model Asdf;

	controller json input validation

	http query method
	emailing interface
	email and text obfuscation
		thinking of just using a series of spans and divs to break up text and invisible text spans thrown in for good measure
		alternatively image based rendering
	email validation
	secure encrypted tokens to use for validation
		send email with IV + AES-encrypt(IV+sha256(email))
		validate by recieving email, token... compare AES-decrypt(token) to IV + sha256(email)

		simple interface of create_token("my_string"), then validate_token("my_string", token)

	easy plugin interface
		plugins inject directly into controllers
			override routing to existing controllers - to add their own paths or override existing paths
			override template hook - to override templates
			hook existing controller events - allow override of existing events or simply hooking them
				also allow hooking events in HTTPRequestExecutor like, init, on_request, on_response, after_response
			inject controllers
			inject templates
			inject models (how will they be registered in the database?)
		plugins should be stored in a plugins folder in the root of the main application
		plugins are enabled from config
			each plugin has a load_plugin.php which requires in the includes.php and loads a Plugin object
			the plugin object is passed to the active runtime which keeps track of all active plugins
			when a hookable action occurs, the runtime is called first to let it process hooks beforehand
				$runtime->on_event("MainController:say_hello", $args);
				$runtime->on_path("MainController:/stuff", $args);
			runtime iterates through all of its active plugins to see if any of them have hooks for the given items
				foreach ($this->active_plugins as $plugin)
					if (isset($plugin->event_hooks[$event_identifier]))
						$plugin->{$plugin->event_hooks[$event_identifier]}($args);


		plugin MagicPlugin {
			// hook a possible controller event
			hook event MainController:say_hello [int a, int b] {
				// do stuff
			}
			// hook the primary request executor
			hook event HTTPRequestExecutor:on_request [req] {
			}
			// hook and override the event
			// overriding presents the problem of plugin conflict
			hook event MainController:say_hello [int a, int b] !override {}

			// hook template blocks to inject another template
			// directly adds the html from MyContentTemplate to the content block
			hook template MainPageTemplate:content => MyContentTemplate;

			// filter-style hook actions?
			hook action MainController {}

			// hook path and perform actions on it before the main controller
			hook path MainController:"/asdf" {
			}
		}

		hook event HTTPRequestExecutor:on_request [req] {
			request_ip = native::StatsTrackerRequestLib.get_request_ip();

			request_referrer = native::StatsTrackerRequestLib.get_request_referrer();

				model::StatsTrackerReferrerRecordModel.upsert({request_referrer=request_referrer, request_path=request_path, request_count=1}, {request_count={increment=1}});

	extentions system
		extensions can inject their own native library
		stored under libs folder
		they extend the functionality of the active runtime object to add their own apis

	parenthesis expressions
	controller referencing
	fail2ban extension/plugin with easy interface
		on failed login, can call plugins.fail2ban.failed_login()
		on successful login, can call plugins.fail2ban.successful_login()
		test whether the ip is banned: plugins.fail2ban.is_banned()

		use ip-indexed model counting strikes against it
			success resets strikes to zero
		settings set in config.php for ban-threshold
